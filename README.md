XtraBYtes is a newly invented algorithm that does not require any traditional 
type of mining support, such as: POW or POS. We have created something called
Proof of Signature which ensure that 100% of all blocks will be signed by the
system when they occur. The blocks are signed by the system after verifying 
the transactions in the block. There are a total of 650 million XBY and there
will never be more. 

The XtraBYtes system is a BLOCKTECH SUPERCHAIN which will start with a database
 storage system that will never break like some systems because we do not rely 
 on miners who could turn their rigs to other coins, leaving the network unable
 to verify and therefore breaking the blockchain, rendering it useless and thus
 all clients losing access to their stored files. This can never happen to
 XtraBYtes.

Additional services will include: X-Secure Contracts, X-Protect Patents, 
X-Actions Financial tools, X-Chat Messaging and other high interest Blockchain
Innovations.

The system functions through a network of trusted STaTiC nodes which are 
connected both physically and virtually through our unique and powerful VITALS
network with consistent global communications through the PULSE message system
which ensures all blocks are signed and secured within function specific time
frames.
